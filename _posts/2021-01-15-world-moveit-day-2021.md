The sixth annual World MoveIt Day, taking place on Wednesday March 10th 2021, is going to look a little different this year. COVID restrictions will once again keep the event virtual but we want to do our best to help bring the community together in these continued uncertain times. As an open source platform, MoveIt relies on our community and our goal this year is to increase our community involvement. 
 
World MoveIt Day is an international hackathon to improve the MoveIt code base, documentation, and community. We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements for the now seven year old framework. Beginners are welcome to join us to review the tutorials and get immediate help when needed. This year, the focus will be on improvements to MoveIt 2.
 
In addition to our hackathon, we will have scheduled lightning talks, fireside chats, prizes and more. 
 
Wait - did you say prizes?
 
Yes! Participate in World MoveItDay 2021 solo or as part of a team.  Winners will go into the MoveIt Hall of Fame and prizes will be awarded to those who:
- Have the most lines merged at the end of the day - team prize
- Merge the most PR’s - individual prize
- Review the most PR’s - individual prize
- Best lightning talk
 
Please register for World MoveIt Day here.

## How To Get Involved

### Squash Bugs / Issues

Suggested areas for improvement are tracked on the [MoveIt 2 repository](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2). Our team of maintainers is working on finding and labeling suggested issues for the event. 

If you would like to help the MoveIt project by tackling an issue, make sure to claim the issue by commenting before you start working:

    > “I’ll work on this for WMD 2021”.

Feel free to ask further questions in each issue’s comments.

### Improve the Docs

Improving our documentation for new and current users is always a goal of WMD!

<!-- need to update for Moveit 2 tutorials when ready -->
<!-- Further needs for documentation and tutorials improvement can be found directly on the [moveit_tutorials issue tracker](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/issues). -->

If you have studied an aspect of MoveIt extensively that is not currently documented, please convert your notes into a pull request in the appropriate location. If you’ve
started a conversation on the mailing list or other location where a more experienced developer explained a concept, consider converting that answer into a pull request
to help others in the future with the same question.

For more details on modifying documentation, see [Contributing](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/).

### Add Features

Generally a single day event is not enough time to complete a new feature, so we recommend you are sure you are committed to seeing the work through beyond World MoveIt Day before tackling a new feature.

Other larger code sprint ideas can be found on [this page](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/future_projects/).
While they will take longer than a day, the ideas might provide a good reference for other things to contribute on WMD.

## Common & Beginner Questions
